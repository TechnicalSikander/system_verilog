# system_verilog
I am going to do various hardware architecture with the help of system verilog .
1. Barrel Shifter 
2. Universal Shift Reg N=8
3. Counter
    3.1 binary counter with N bits as a parameter
    3.2 Mod M counter count 0 to M-1
4. FSM (multistage and two stage coding style)
5. rising Edge Detector
   Mealy and Moore
6. Debounce ckt with delay one debounce
